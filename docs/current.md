## Current Time / System Time Zone

Julia provides the `now()` method to retrieve your current system's time as a `DateTime`. The TimeZones.jl package provides an additional method to the `now` function providing the current time as a `ZonedDateTime`:

```julia
now(tz"Europe/Warsaw")
```

To get the `TimeZone` currently specified on you system you can use `localzone()`. Combining this method with the new `now` method produces the current system time in the current system's time zone:

```julia
now(localzone())
```
